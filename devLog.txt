well there are two algorithms I can think of how snake should move
1. on every movement left,righ.. just add new cell and delete last cell
this way cells don't really need to know their future positions, no cells will move just add & delete 

2. make an snakeTrail array, where we will have coordinates of each cell, and on every movement just add new positions to array
remove last positions , and than update all cells so they render on their new positions

3. oh actually i can think third way, on every movement just move last cell to new position left, right ...

snakeTrail is array of cell coordinate objects
